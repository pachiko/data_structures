For some reason, the Maven Local Repository path in IntelliJ is absolute rather than relative.
This causes the JAR files from CS61B to be missing.
(Not really missing, but they are re-downloaded to the old path but there is no masterpom.xml to index them)

So, we need to change the path in .idea/workspace.xml

<component name="MavenImportPreferences">
    <option name="generalSettings">
      <MavenGeneralSettings>
        <option name="localRepository"

Run this Bash shell command on root folder:
find . -type f -name "workspace.xml" -exec sed -i -- 's#A:\\skeleton-sp21\\library-sp21\\javalib#A:\\LEARN\\Implementations\\Foundation\\data_structures\\library-sp21\\javalib#g' {} +

Note the single-quotes on the replacement string.
Also note that the separator doesn't have to be s/A/B/g, can also use s;A;B;g or any other delimiter not found in the string
{} +  is for find ... -exec ... to run the exec command for all files found
